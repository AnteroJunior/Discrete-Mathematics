# Discrete-Mathematics
Basic programs used in Discrete Mathematics discipline in order to understand how criptography works using private and public keys.

First of all we are going to use simple programs to work with prime numbers:<br>
1- Check if a number 'n' is prime;<br>
2- Decompose a number 'n' in it's prime factors;<br>
3- Get Least Commom Multiple(LCM) and get Greatest Common Divisor(GCD);<br>
4- Get the Greatest Common Divisor(GCD) using Euclides Algorithm;<br>
